# Airlines Management System â€“ Internship Project

This project was developed as part of my **Summer Internship at Greaves Travel India Pvt. Ltd.** (May 2025 â€“ July 2025). The goal was to implement a robust backend system simulating key features of an airline management platform, using real-world flight and airport datasets.

## ðŸ”§ Features Implemented

- **MVC Architecture**: Structured the project using the Model-View-Controller paradigm for clean code separation and scalability.
- **City Autocomplete**: Integrated an autocomplete feature for city names based on airport data using real-time filtering.
- **Role-Based Login System**: Developed separate login functionalities for:
  - Admin
  - Super Admin
  - General Users
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Stored Procedures**: Created multiple MySQL stored procedures to support complex transactional logic and data operations.
- **MongoDB Atlas Integration**: Leveraged cloud-based MongoDB Atlas for data handling and management workflows.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL (with stored procedures), MongoDB Atlas
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **API Tools**: Postman
- **Architecture**: MVC
